Python: selected examples of short python scripts I have written for my engineering studies

Much of the coding I did in my engineering degree involved using scripting languages (C, java, python, matlab) to perform complex mathematical computations and physics simulations applicable to the engineering concepts I was learning.

I have included in this repository examples of the many short python scripts I have written in Jupyter notebook. View the "result.pdf" file in eachfolder to see what what I wrote for the respective assignment and to see its results. For those not familiar with Jupyter notebook, the text in the grey boxes is a piece of code that gets executed and the white space in between the blocks shows the output of the results preceding it.
